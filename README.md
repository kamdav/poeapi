In this project I have used React for the first time. I am a junior front end developer but I have given my best shot at learning how to create this as quickly as possible. I have managed to access the api and display some information. The data I have decided to display are some characters from an online game called Path of Exile. I have used arrays to seperate the characters based on their class. Had I more time to learn and practise I would have liked to create a button for each class that displays only that specific class when clicked on. I understand this does not fit the full requirements of the test but I spent just over a day creating this without any prior knowledge of React.
Thanks!
